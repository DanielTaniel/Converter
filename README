The Selenium script is designed to upload questions from CSVs to the quiz 
using the wordpress interface. The script expect a url of the quiz 
interface page for the quiz manager page wrapped in ''
e.g. $ ./handler.py 'https://cope.kitson-consulting.co.uk/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw_quiz_options&quiz_id=12'

The CSV expects answers a strict format as outlined in the .csv files.

Known bugs
